              Hi! My name is Kriska. I was born in a small town in the
              Philippines then I moved to Thailand at 16 and lived there for 10
              years. Currently, I live in Amsterdam, married to a Dutchie.
              Having gained experiences from multicultural and multilingual
              environments turned me to become an adaptable, well-rounded
              individual. Currently, I work at Jungle Gym as a Digital Marketer
              with a specialization in UX and UI design. I use design thinking
              methodologies to improve our shopping experience. I facilitate in
              conceptualizing, shaping ideas, prototyping, and testing
              interaction strategies. I am dedicated to learning and
              understanding both user and business needs to come up with a
              balanced solution to complex problems. I'm inspired by films,
              music, fashion, and video games. In my free time, I enjoy learning
              new skills, and currently, thatâ€™s coding in Javascript.
